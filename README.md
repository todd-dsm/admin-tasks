# admin-tasks

This is a patchwork of sys-admin commands that have served me well over the years. I've been doing this stuff for almost 30 years and for some reason I have to look this stuff up - every single time :expressionless:

So, I'm constantly looking up some of the most valuable tools in the tool belt. Maybe it's time to share/purge them?

This repo is a collection of those commands/tools/techniques.

If you're looking to become a more powerful sys-admin, this is the bulk of what you'll need. I can move mountains with Vim, Bash and OpenSSH. Alternately, if you're looking level-up your DevOps skills, there probably isn't a lot of value here.

The Main Sections are:
* [security]
* [shell] Stuff
  * [vim]
  * shell scripting: `bash`
  * systems/operational widgets
* [sed], curated one-liners
* [awk] 1-Liners
* [find]
* [missileanus] odds and ends.

These things are deteriorating in usefulness every year; the new tools require less and less of this stuff. Personally, I'll be happy when these things are no longer required at all. But, until then...

These are _ONLY_ the useful commands; the stuff I can't live without. I hope they work as well for you as the do for me.

Cheers!
